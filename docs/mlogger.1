.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Nm mlogger
makes massive entries in the system log.
It provides a shell command interface to the
.Xr syslog  3
system log module.

.Nm mlogger
is a fork of logger, patched to allow for extremely long log line as well as indented multi line support

.Pp
Options:
.Pp

.Bl -tag -width "message"
.It Fl d, Fl Fl udp
Use datagram (UDP) instead of the default stream connection (TCP).

.It Fl i, Fl Fl id
Log the process ID of the mlogger process with each line.

.It Fl f, Fl Fl file Ar file
Log the contents of the specified \fIfile\fR.  This option cannot be
combined with a command-line message.

.It Fl h, Fl Fl help
Display a help text and exit.

.It Fl n, Fl Fl server Ar server
Write to the specified remote syslog
.Ar server
using UDP instead of to the builtin syslog routines.

.It Fl P, Fl Fl port Ar port
Use the specified UDP
.Ar port  .
The default port number is 514.

.It Fl p, Fl Fl priority Ar priority
Enter the message into the log with the specified
.Ar priority  .
The priority may be specified numerically or as a \fIfacility.level\fR
pair.
For example, \fB-p local3.info\fR logs the message as
informational in the local3 facility.
The default is \fIuser.notice\fR.

.It Fl s, Fl Fl stderr
Output the message to standard error as well as to the system log.

.It Fl t, Fl Fl tag Ar tag
Mark every line to be logged with the specified
.Ar tag  .

.It Fl u, Fl Fl socket Ar socket
Write to the specified
.Ar socket
instead of to the builtin syslog routines.

.It Fl I, Fl Fl indent Ar ms
Consider lines indented with a space or tab continuation of the previous line.
If no new log lines have been received by the timeout
.Ar ms
the current line will be logged as is.

There is no default value for
.Ar ms

.It Fl V, Fl Fl version
Display version information and exit.

.It --
End the argument list. This is to allow the
.Ar message
to start with a hyphen (\-).
.It Ar message
Write the message to log; if not specified, and the
.Fl f
flag is not
provided, standard input is logged.
